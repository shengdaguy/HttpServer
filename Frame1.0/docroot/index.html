you ain't gonna believe this.But you used to fit right here.I hold you up and said to your mother.This kid's gonna be the best in the world.This kid's gonna be somebody better than anybody ever knew.And you grew up good and wonderful.It was great just watching you, every day was like a privilege.Then the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world. And you did.But somewhere on the line,you changed.You stopped being you.You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you're no good.And when things got hard, you start to look for something to blame like a big shadow.Let me tell you something you already know.The world ain't all sunshines and rainbows.It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it'll beat you to your knees and keep it there permanently if you let it.You, me and nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.But it ain't about how hard you hit.It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward How much you can take and keep moving forward.That's how winning is done.Now if you know what you worth, go out and get what you worth.But you gotta be willing to take the hits.And not pointing fingers saying you ain't what you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody.Cowards do that and that ain't you.You're better than that!
